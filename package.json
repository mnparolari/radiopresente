For those who do not know about the history, the Ex CCDTyE were places used to torture, interrogate, rape, hold illegally detained and eventually murder people, and they operated during the last military dictatorship in Argentina between 1975 and 1983. For all this, the operation of a radio is symbolically important; to give voice, to give life to a space in which there was, for many years, a lot of death.</h3>",
